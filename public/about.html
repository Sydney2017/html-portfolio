<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  My name is Sydney Moagi, a dedicated and hardworking individual with a passion
  for technology, gaming, and continuous learning. I am currently completing my
  BSc in Informatics and Computer Science at the University of Johannesburg.
  Despite financial challenges that delayed my studies, I have persevered and am
  on track to graduate soon. I also hold an certifications from Cisco Networking
  Academy in Networking Basics, Cybersecurity Basics, and Computer Hardware

  Professionally, I work remotely as a Front-End Developer at Diamond Pinnacle
  IT Solutions, where I have gained a year of experience collaborating via
  Discord and using GitHub for version control. My technical skills include
  desktop troubleshooting, network administration, Windows Server deployment,
  Microsoft 365 management, and virtualization. Additionally, I am currently
  focused on improving my expertise in JavaScript and its frameworks, such as
  React, jQuery, and Node.js, to enhance my job prospects.

  Outside of work and studies, I am a passionate gamer who enjoys playing
  high-performance titles like FC 25, Red Dead Redemption 2, and Forza Horizon 5
  etc. I also love soccer, both playing and watching. Family is very important
  to meâ€”I have a 5-year-old daughter in Grade R who dreams of becoming a doctor.
  I take pride in guiding and supporting her as she grows. In addition, I have a
  strong entrepreneurial spirit, having previously run a business selling archer
  with my girlfriend. Despite setbacks, I remain resilient and open to new
  opportunities.
